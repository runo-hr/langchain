# LangChain for LLM Application Development

This project demonstrates how to leverage LangChain for developing applications using Large Language Models (LLMs). The components include models, prompts, memory management, chains, document handling, vector stores, retrieval systems, question answering, and conversational interfaces.

## Components

1. **Models, Prompts, and Parsers**  
   File: [promts_parsers.py](/promts_parsers.py)  
   Overview: Defines the models, prompts, and parsers used in the application. This includes setting up the LLM, creating prompt templates, and parsing responses.

2. **Memory**  
   File: [memory.py](/memory.py)  
   Overview: Manages conversational memory to maintain context in interactions. This is crucial for applications requiring multi-turn dialogues.

3. **Chains**  
   File: [chains.py](/chains.py)  
   Overview: Constructs various chains, including RetrievalQA and ConversationalRetrievalChain, to handle question answering and conversation management.

4. **Document Loading**  
   File: [document_loaders.py](/document_loaders.py)  
   Overview: Handles the loading of documents from various sources, including PDFs. Implements functionality to load and preprocess documents for further analysis.

5. **Document Splitting**  
   File: [document_splitting.py](/document_splitting.py)  
   Overview: Splits large documents into manageable chunks to improve the efficiency of retrieval and processing.

6. **Vectorstores and Embeddings**  
   File: [vectorstores_embeddings.py](/vectorstores_embeddings.py)  
   Overview: Creates and manages vector stores using embeddings to support similarity searches and other retrieval tasks.

7. **Retrieval**  
   File: [retrieval.py](/retrieval.py)  
   Overview: Implements various retrieval techniques, including similarity search, maximum marginal relevance search, and metadata-based retrieval.

8. **Question and Answering**  
   File: [question_answering.py](/question_answering.py)  
   Overview: Constructs and runs QA chains to answer questions based on the retrieved information from the vector store.

9. **Chat with Your Documents**  
   File: [chat.py](/chat.py)  
   Overview: Implements a conversational chatbot that interacts with documents, supporting both single-turn and multi-turn dialogues with memory management.
